These com.sun.* classes are empty placeholders, 
just used to compile against. 
They are not included in lwpd.commons.xml.jar
because we want to use the classes provided by the Sun JRE instead.
The code that uses those classes is only executed on the Mac,
where the Sun JRE is used instead of the IBM JRE.
See com.ibm.commons.xml/localCustomBuildCallbacks.xml
